### About Heart Disease
Heart disease refers to several types of heart conditions. The most common in the U.S. is coronary artery disease (CAD), which reduces blood flow to the heart and can cause a heart attack. In 2022, about 1 in 5 deaths in the U.S. were from heart disease.

### Heart Disease Symptoms
Heart disease can be silent until a serious event occurs. Common symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in extremities, and fluttering in the chest. These can indicate heart attack, arrhythmia, or heart failure.

### Heart Disease Risk Factors
Major risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. Others include diabetes, obesity, poor diet, physical inactivity, and excessive alcohol use. Genetics, age, and race/ethnicity also contribute to risk.

### Treatment and Recovery
Cardiac rehabilitation helps patients recover from heart attacks and surgeries. It involves physical activity, diet education, medication adherence, smoking cessation, and mental health support. A multidisciplinary team provides tailored care.

### Heart Attack Overview
A heart attack (myocardial infarction) occurs when part of the heart doesn’t get enough blood. CAD is the main cause. Symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, and pain in the jaw, neck, or arms. Immediate medical attention is critical.

### Heart Attack Recovery
Recovery may require lifestyle changes, medication, and cardiac rehab. Risk of future complications can be reduced with healthy habits, managing stress, and following medical advice. Regular follow-ups with healthcare providers are essential.

### Health Conditions That Increase Risk
Conditions like high blood pressure, high LDL cholesterol, and diabetes significantly increase heart disease risk. Managing these conditions through medication and lifestyle changes can help reduce overall risk.

### Behaviors That Increase Risk
Unhealthy eating, physical inactivity, smoking, and excessive alcohol use are key behavioral risk factors. Improving diet, increasing activity, and quitting smoking are major preventive steps.

### Other Risk Factors
Age, sex, genetics, and race/ethnicity can also affect heart disease risk. While some factors can’t be changed, managing controllable ones can significantly lower the overall risk.
