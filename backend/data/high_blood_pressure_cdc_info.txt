### What is High Blood Pressure
High blood pressure (hypertension) occurs when the force of blood pushing against artery walls is consistently at or above 130/80 mm Hg. It usually has no symptoms but can lead to heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, and vision problems if unmanaged.

### Diagnosis and Measurement
Blood pressure is measured using systolic and diastolic values. Normal is less than 120/80 mm Hg. High blood pressure is diagnosed when consistently 130/80 mm Hg or higher. Regular monitoring is the only way to detect it.

### Causes and Risk Factors
Hypertension may develop due to poor lifestyle choices, obesity, diabetes, lack of physical activity, or stress. Risk factors also include genetics, aging, and environmental conditions. Managing these factors can reduce the risk.

### Health Risks and Complications
High blood pressure can lead to heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, heart valve disease, kidney damage, and cognitive decline. It reduces blood and oxygen flow to critical organs, increasing the risk of serious health conditions.

### Prevention and Lifestyle Changes
Prevent hypertension by staying physically active, avoiding tobacco, limiting salt and alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight, and managing stress. Adopting these habits can lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of related diseases.

### Managing High Blood Pressure
Control high blood pressure by monitoring it regularly and managing other conditions such as diabetes. Make positive lifestyle changes and, if needed, take medications as prescribed by your healthcare team.

### Medication for High Blood Pressure
Various medicines help manage blood pressure by removing excess water, relaxing blood vessels, or reducing heart workload. Classes include ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics. Always consult your doctor before changing medications.

### Side Effects and Risks of Medication
Most blood pressure medications are well-tolerated but may cause dizziness, swelling, or stomach issues. Over-the-counter meds like nasal decongestants can interfere with treatment. Discuss all medicines and supplements with your provider.

### Creating a Care Plan
Work with your healthcare team to create a tailored plan including lifestyle adjustments and medications. Track your readings and ask questions during checkups to stay on top of your health.
