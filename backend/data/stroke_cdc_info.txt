### What is a Stroke
A stroke occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain is blocked or a blood vessel in the brain bursts, leading to brain damage or death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic (caused by blockage) and hemorrhagic (caused by bleeding). A transient ischemic attack (TIA), or 'mini-stroke,' is a temporary blockage but a serious warning sign.

### Signs and Symptoms of Stroke
Symptoms include sudden numbness or weakness, confusion, trouble speaking, difficulty seeing, loss of balance, or a severe headache. Act F.A.S.T.: Face drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulty, Time to call 9-1-1. Immediate care improves treatment outcomes.

### When to Seek Emergency Help
Stroke treatments are most effective when started within 3 hours of symptoms. Call 9-1-1 immediately if a stroke is suspected. Do not drive; use emergency services so treatment can begin en route to the hospital.

### Types of Stroke
Ischemic stroke is caused by blood clots or plaque blocking brain vessels. Hemorrhagic stroke results from a ruptured blood vessel. TIAs are short-term blockages but carry a high risk of future strokes if untreated.

### Risk Factors: Medical Conditions
Conditions increasing stroke risk include previous strokes or TIAs, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and sickle cell disease. Proper management with healthcare providers is essential to reduce risk.

### Risk Factors: Lifestyle Behaviors
Smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, poor diet, and physical inactivity all increase stroke risk. Adopting healthier habits can significantly reduce the likelihood of stroke.

### Risk Factors: Other Factors
Family history, age, sex, and race/ethnicity can influence stroke risk. Older adults, women, and Black individuals are at higher risk. Understanding personal risk factors can guide preventive steps.

### What to Do After a TIA
A TIA or 'mini-stroke' should never be ignored. Although symptoms go away, the risk of a full stroke remains high. Seek medical attention immediately to prevent major stroke outcomes through evaluation and treatment.
