### Preventing Type 2 Diabetes Through Lifestyle Changes
The CDC-led National Diabetes Prevention Program offers a lifestyle change program proven to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. It includes coaching, group support, and a year-long program focused on diet, physical activity, and stress management. Losing just 5% to 7% of body weight and doing at least 150 minutes of activity per week can reduce risk by 58% (71% for people 60+).

### Prediabetes Awareness and Prevention
Over 98 million U.S. adults have prediabetes, but most are unaware. Prediabetes increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Weight loss, healthy eating, and physical activity can cut the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in half. Get tested and take action early.

### What Causes Prediabetes?
Prediabetes occurs when cells in the body don't respond well to insulin. As insulin resistance builds, blood sugar levels rise. This is a warning stage before developing type 2 diabetes, and is often symptomless. Risk factors include age, weight, genetics, and physical inactivity.

### Signs and Risk Factors of Prediabetes
Risk factors include being overweight, over 45, having a family history of diabetes, low physical activity, and certain ethnic backgrounds. You may not experience symptoms, so testing is essential. Lifestyle changes can help delay or prevent progression to type 2 diabetes.

### Diabetes and the Immune System
Diabetes weakens the immune system. High blood sugar makes it harder for white blood cells to fight infections, increasing the risk of respiratory, skin, and urinary tract infections. Proper blood sugar management, a healthy diet, regular exercise, and vaccinations are important for boosting immunity in people with diabetes.

### Tips for Staying Healthy With Diabetes
Control blood sugar levels, eat a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables, stay physically active, manage stress, wash hands often, and get enough sleep. These steps support your immune system and help prevent complications from infections and chronic inflammation.

### Vaccination Guidelines for People With Diabetes
People with diabetes should stay current on vaccines. Recommendations include: COVID-19, influenza annually, pneumococcal for adults over 65 or with conditions, hepatitis B under age 60, shingles for those 50+, and Tdap every 10 years. Vaccines help prevent serious illness that can worsen diabetes.
