### About Asthma
Asthma is a chronic disease that affects the lungs and causes wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing. It is common among children but also affects adults. Asthma symptoms are always present, but attacks occur when the lungs are irritated by triggers.

### Symptoms of Asthma
Asthma attacks include wheezing, chest tightness, coughing, and trouble breathing. The airways swell, narrow, and fill with mucus, restricting airflow. Recognizing early warning signs and avoiding triggers are key to controlling asthma.

### Asthma Diagnosis
Asthma can be hard to diagnose, especially in children under 5. Doctors ask about coughing, breathing patterns, activity triggers, and family history. A spirometry test may be done to measure lung function before and after using asthma medication.

### Symptom Management and Medication
Medications for asthma include relievers (quick-acting) and controllers (long-term). Everyone’s treatment may differ. Inhaled or oral medications help reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. Always follow your doctor’s instructions and monitor for side effects.

### Controlling Triggers at Home
Home visitors can help identify asthma triggers such as dust mites and mold. Reducing these triggers through simple, low-cost actions and proper medical care improves health. Checklists and training are available to assist in home evaluations.

### Emergency Care for Asthma
During emergencies, follow your Asthma Action Plan and take medication as prescribed. Keep at least a 30-day supply on hand. Avoid triggers and ensure inhalers are used correctly. Stress and strong emotions can worsen asthma symptoms.

### Cleaning and Disinfecting Safely
People with asthma should avoid strong cleaning chemicals. Others should clean instead, and windows should be opened for ventilation. Avoid spraying disinfectants into the air; instead, apply to cloths and wipe surfaces. Always follow label instructions.

### Emergency Prescription Assistance Program (EPAP)
In federally declared disaster areas, EPAP helps uninsured individuals obtain prescriptions, medical supplies, or equipment. Call 1-855-793-7470 to find out if EPAP is activated in your area.
